### What is an AI Prompt Decorator?

An **AI Prompt Decorator** is a special tool (plugin) that modifies the request sent to an AI model. Think of it as someone who proofreads or edits your question before sending it to a smart assistant.

When you use AI models (like ChatGPT or other large language models) via your API Gateway, you might want to:

*   Add extra context or instructions.
    
*   Modify the user’s prompt to ensure the AI understands better.
    
*   Make prompts safer, clearer, or aligned with certain policies.
    

This is exactly what the **AI Prompt Decorator** does.

### Simple Example:

**Without the AI Prompt Decorator:**

*   User prompt:
    
    ```
    "Tell me about lions"
    ```
    
*   AI directly receives:
    
    ```
    "Tell me about lions"
    ```
    
*   AI responds freely about lions.
    

**With the AI Prompt Decorator:**

*   User prompt:
    
    ```
    "Tell me about lions"
    ```
    
*   AI Prompt Decorator modifies the request:
    
    ```
    "You are an animal expert. Provide a short, clear explanation about lions suitable for children."
    ```
    
*   AI receives the modified request and responds specifically with child-friendly information about lions.

### What happens without an AI Prompt Decorator?

Without this decorator:

*   You have **less control** over the AI’s response.
    
*   The AI might misunderstand the user's intent.
    
*   Responses may be too broad, inaccurate, or inappropriate.
    
*   Users might have to manually rephrase their prompts for better responses.

### Why it matters (Summary):

| With AI Prompt Decorator ✅ | Without AI Prompt Decorator ❌ |
| --- | --- |
| Precise, controlled responses. | Generic or unpredictable responses. |
| Easier to enforce specific rules. | Difficult to enforce standards. |
| Enhanced safety and clarity. | Higher risk of misunderstanding. |

* * *

**In short:**

An AI Prompt Decorator in an API Gateway is a smart filter that edits or shapes the prompts sent to an AI model, ensuring responses match your needs and standards. Without it, you risk inconsistent, unclear, or unintended responses.
