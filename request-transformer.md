## Response:
Imagine you're at a restaurant and you're ordering food. You say:

> "I want a burger with cheese and fries."

But suppose the kitchen needs orders in a different format, like:

> "Burger: Cheese = Yes; Side = Fries."

Someone (a waiter) has to translate your request into the kitchen's language so they understand exactly what to make.

**A Request Transformer in an API Gateway** works just like that waiter.

### What is a Request Transformer?

A **Request Transformer** is a feature (or plugin) in an API Gateway. Its job is to **change (or transform)** incoming requests before they reach your backend services.

This can involve:

*   **Adding** extra information.
    
*   **Removing** unnecessary information.
    
*   **Changing** the structure of the request (e.g., renaming fields).
    

* * *

### Example:

Let's say your backend expects a request like this:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

But your users send requests like this:

```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe"
}
```

Your Request Transformer in the API Gateway would:

1.  **Split** `"fullName": "John Doe"` into two separate fields.
    
2.  **Create** a request that the backend understands:
    

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

Now your backend doesn't need to know anything about how users format their requests.

### What happens without a Request Transformer?

If you don't use a Request Transformer, your backend services have to directly handle all sorts of different formats, versions, and variations from users.

This causes several problems:

*   **Complexity**: Your backend code becomes complicated with logic to handle different request formats.
    
*   **Maintenance Difficulty**: Any change on the user-side request format requires changes to your backend code.
    
*   **Errors**: Increased chances of mistakes and failures if requests aren't standardized.
    

* * *

### Summary in Simple Words:

**Request Transformer** is like a **translator** that modifies incoming requests into the exact format your backend expects. Without it, your backend would struggle with multiple formats and become complex and error-prone.
